                I also used ride in real life! Unfortuatly I haven't been able to since 
                going to university, but I plan on going back to it in the future. Here 
                is a picture of me at my last barn riding a school horse Sammy when I was 17.

                Me at 15 riding Sadie bareback as she does a tiny crow hop. She was a school
                pony but she felt like my own because I was one of the only people who rode her.
                Fun fact: I cried when she retired and her owner took her back to Oregon.

        I specialize in drastic custom model horses, but I do all forms
        of art not involving horses as well. I mainly work with breyer horses but also 
        babble in artist resins as well and have my own artist resin release "Triton" 
        limited to 45
        pieces and is for sale on my ebay. I love everything wacky, fun, and colorful.
        I do both realism and fantasy, but I find fantasy to be way more fun.

            Yes, I do commissions, send me a message. However its important to know that 
            I am very hesitant about doing portraits of real horses. Your horse deserves
            a perfect portrait, but I am specialized in fantasy customs and there are hundreds
            of model horse artists who are specialized in realistic repaints who would be 
            a much safer option to replicate your horse perfectly in mini.

            Some terms to know:
        </h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Custom Model Horse</dt>
            <dd>
                Taking a plastic horse and changing it in anyway, such as repainting it.
            </dd>
            <dt>Drastic Custom Model Horse</dt>
            <dd>Making drastic changes. Such as cutting off or fully removing 
                parts of the horse to replace it either with parts from a different horse 
                or sculpting new parts from clay. This process can involve the original 
                model being chopped up into a dozen pieces before being put back together 
                into something completly unrecognizable. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Artist Resin</dt>
            <dd>Limited sculpts created by individual artists then cast and molded. 
                Usually limited to 25-100 pieces. They tend to be quite expensive because
                you are paying for something really special. I've seen painted artist
                resins selling for up to 6 thousand dollars, while unpainted traditional sized 
                ones hover around the 200-600 dollar mark. These are beautiful and 
                unique pieces, always much higher quality then what companies produce.
