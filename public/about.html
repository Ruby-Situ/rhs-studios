        I specialize in drastic custom model horses, but I do all forms
        of art. I mainly work with breyer horses but also babble in artist resin
        horses as well and have my own artist resin release "Triton" limited to 45
        pieces and is for sale on my ebay. I love everything wacky, fun, and colorful.

        I have only a small portion of my work posted here, but I am working to add more.

            Some terms to know:
        </h5>
        <dl>
            <dt>Custom Model Horse</dt>
            <dd>
                Taking a plastic horse and changing it in anyway, such as repainting it.
            </dd>
            <dt>Drastic Custom Model Horse</dt>
            <dd>Making drastic changes. Such as cutting off or fully removing 
                parts of the horse to replace it either with parts from a different horse 
                or sculpting new parts from clay. This process can involve the original 
                model being chopped up into a dozen pieces before being put back together 
                into something completly unrecognizable. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Artist Resin</dt>
            <dd>Limited sculpts created by individual artists then cast and molded. 
                Usually limited to 25-100 pieces. They tend to be quite expensive because
                you are paying for something every special. I've seen painted artist
                resins selling for up to 6 thousand dollars, while unpainted traditional sized 
                ones hover around the 200-600 dollar mark. These are beautiful and 
                unique pieces, always much higher quality then what companies produce.
